=Processing of Incoming Calls=

Basically, this program first filters all incoming calls using black/white lists, and then handles the remaining calls
according to settings specified for different call types and for individual phone numbers.
The processing of all (filtered or not) calls may also be overridden by auto-answer settings.

The call types are:

 * number in contacts;
 * number not in contacts;
 * unknown numbers.

The default settings for each call type are:

 * none (do not process at all);
 * record the call;
 * hang up;
 * mute the ring (further recording is impossible if you put the phone off-hook);
 * in-call manual control.

The last option is experimental, and may be used to start/stop recording of multiple call fragments during the call.

These settings are defined in main "Incoming calls" menu.

As for the filtering, you may maintain multiple black and white lists, quickly reloading them using "Load" menu command.

Only *one* list (either black or white) may be active at each specific time moment.
This is defined by "Blacklists and exceptions -> B/W lists mode" setting (see Figure below).
Switching to white lists may be useful, e.g., when you are busy and inclined to speak only to a limited number of your callers.

The "Black lists and exceptions->Exceptions" list for individual numbers is ignored when a black or white list
is active (i.e., the B/W lists mode is not "Off"): it is used to override further default processing of (known) numbers
for the first two call types. 

However, the "Autoanswer settings->Exceptions" list may be used to override the default
auto-answer files for those lists.
As shown in the following Figure, the auto-answer is _always immediate_ for black and white lists, moreover, in case of black lists,
the callers' answers are never recorded.
