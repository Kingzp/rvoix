#summary Devices supported by rvoix

In principle, this program should work on any device provided that this device is based on a Qualcomm chip, either old (msm72xx) or new one (snapdragons like qsd8x50/msm8x55/msm7x30).

However, many device manufacturers do not provide necessary support for 2-way recording in their ROMs. 

For old devices (and for newer ones based on msm7227 widely used now) it is readily checked: you must have files named "voc*" in /dev directory. If you haven't, you've got to ask somebody. 

For newer devices, almost surely, you have to install the updated kernel. Please look at xda forum, the chances are there exists the patch.
